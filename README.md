# Diversity pro meetups & conferences in Belgium

This is a curated list of developer-related meetup groups and conferences that are pro diversity in our tech community. 

All meetup groups and conferences are welcome to add themselves as long as these requisites are met:

- your meetup or conference includes some kind of **focus on computer programming** or something very close related. (this may vary from game development to frontend and so on...)
- your meetup or conference is **located in Belgium**
- your meetup or conference cares about **diversity in tech**


To add your meetup or conference **create a pull request**.

P.S. Suggestions for improvement are welcome! (such as missing info or columns...)
